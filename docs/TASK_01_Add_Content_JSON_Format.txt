		//			1. the segmented content is compressed in a .tar.gz file,
						in this case the file format has to be "m3u8-tar.gz" and

		//				1.1 in case of copy:// or cp:// or move:// or mv:// sourceURL, the tar.gz file name will be the same name

		//				1.2 in case of other sourceURL (download) or in case there is a PUSH ingestion,

		//	are taken randomily from a full HLS, in particular it was the HLS streaming
